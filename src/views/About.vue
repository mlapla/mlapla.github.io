      Hi, I'm Michael. Welcome to my personal website. I have worked on this page to try and gather my learnings through my progress in mathematical physics and computer science while also acting as a portfolio. Hence, it gathers projects and personal toughts mostly about cosmology, number theory, algorithms and other varieties.
